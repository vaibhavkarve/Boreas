Non-Unique Games: representation theory calculation

For Cry-EM, we are attempting to reproduce the calculation for SU(2) and SU(3) instead of SO(2) and SO(3).

## SU(2).ipynb
This code uses sympy for calculating traces of the irreducible representations of SU(2). This is useful for approximating the dirac-delta function on this group. Need to figure out the finite truncation to proceed with this calculation.
